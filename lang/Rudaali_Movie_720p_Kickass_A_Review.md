Rudaali is a powerful and poignant film that showcases the talent of Kalpana Lajmi and Dimple Kapadia. The film is available for download in HD 720p quality from various torrent sites such as Kickass. However, downloading pirated content is illegal and unethical, and may harm the filmmakers and the industry. Therefore, it is recommended to watch the film legally from authorized sources.

Rudaali is based on a real practice of hiring professional mourners in some parts of India, especially among the upper caste communities. The film depicts the harsh realities of the lives of these women, who are exploited and marginalized by the society. The film also shows the bond that develops between Shanichari and Bhikni, another rudaali, played by Rakhee Gulzar. The film questions the norms and traditions that oppress women and the lower castes, and celebrates their resilience and courage.
 
The film was praised for its realistic portrayal of the rural setting and the characters, as well as its sensitive direction and screenplay. The film also marked the comeback of Dimple Kapadia, who had taken a break from acting after her marriage to Rajesh Khanna. Kapadia delivered a stunning performance as Shanichari, expressing her grief, anger, pain and hope with subtlety and grace. The film also featured one of the last appearances of Amjad Khan, who played the role of Ram Avtar, a landlord who falls in love with Shanichari.
 
Rudaali is a film that will touch your heart and make you think about the injustices and inequalities that exist in our society. The film is a masterpiece of Indian cinema that deserves to be watched and appreciated by everyone.

Rudaali is also notable for its music, which was composed by the legendary Bhupen Hazarika, who was also a singer, poet and filmmaker. The music of the film reflects the folk and classical traditions of Rajasthan, as well as the influence of Hazarika's native Assam. The songs of the film are sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Bhupen Hazarika and Gulzar. The songs convey the emotions and moods of the characters and the story, and are considered to be among the best works of Hazarika and Gulzar.
 
Rudaali was a commercial success as well as a critical one. The film was screened at various international film festivals, such as Cannes, Chicago and Montreal. The film also received several nominations and awards at various national and regional awards ceremonies. The film won three National Film Awards: Best Actress for Dimple Kapadia, Best Music Direction for Bhupen Hazarika and Best Costume Design for Simple Kapadia. The film also won four Filmfare Awards: Best Film (Critics), Best Actress (Critics) for Dimple Kapadia, Best Story for Mahasweta Devi and Best Dialogue for Gulzar.
 
Rudaali is a film that will stay with you long after you watch it. The film is a tribute to the women who have suffered and struggled in silence, and to the artists who have given voice to their stories. The film is a gem of Indian cinema that should not be missed.
